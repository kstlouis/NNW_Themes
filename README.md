# NNW Themes
Custom themes for the infamous RSS client NetNewsWire.

### Promenade Light
An almost exact clone of the Promenade theme, made by [Stuart Breckenridge](mynameisstuart.com). I loved everything about it except the titles were just a bit too prominent. Everyhting else is unchanged. 

### Broadsheet
Another theme from Stuart Breckenridge. I didn't make any changes; I'm just saving it here in case I mess something up later and nuke anything on my computer.
